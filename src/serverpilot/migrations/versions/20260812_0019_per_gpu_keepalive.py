"""persist desired per-GPU keepalive policy and legacy scope

Revision ID: 20260812_0019
Revises: 20260812_0018
Create Date: 2026-08-12

The old keepalive feature reserved an endpoint's complete GPU set in one
lease.  It is intentionally *not* converted into a collection of new
per-GPU leases: existing active rows are tagged ``legacy_endpoint`` and stay
fail-closed until an operator has explicitly stopped and verified them.
